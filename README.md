## Security

### API Key Security

This project uses environment variables to manage API keys and sensitive configuration data:

1. All API keys are stored in a `.env` file that is not committed to version control
2. A `.env.example` file is provided as a template for setting up your own environment variables
3. Firebase API keys are loaded dynamically through environment variables at runtime

### API Key Rotation Process

If you need to rotate your Firebase API keys (e.g., after a security incident):

1. Generate new API keys in the Firebase console
2. Update your `.env` file with the new keys
3. Revoke the old API keys in the Firebase console
4. Deploy your updated application

### Securing Configuration Files

The following files contain sensitive information and should never be committed to public repositories:

- `.env` - Contains all API keys and sensitive configuration
- `lib/utils/api_keys.dart` - Contains API keys for external services
- `android/app/google-services.json` - Contains Firebase configuration for Android
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` - Contains Firebase configuration for iOS

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions)
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API
- **Voice**: flutter_tts and speech_to_text packages
- **State Management**: Provider pattern

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
- Dart (2.17.0 or higher)
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Firebase CLI (for deployment)

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prescribrapp.git
   cd prescribrapp
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Configure Firebase
   - Create a new Firebase project
   - Add Android & iOS apps to your Firebase project
   - Download and place the google-services.json (Android) and GoogleService-Info.plist (iOS) files
   - Update firebase_options.dart if needed

4. Set up API Keys
   - Create a copy of lib/utils/api_keys.dart.example as lib/utils/api_keys.dart
   - Add your Anthropic API key to the file

5. Run the app
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Android
- Ensure Google Play Services is installed for proper speech recognition
- Grant microphone permissions for voice features

### iOS
- Additional setup for speech recognition required in Info.plist
- TTS functionality uses the native AVSpeechSynthesizer

### Web
- Limited speech recognition capabilities due to browser restrictions
- Requires HTTPS for microphone access

## Known Issues & Solutions

- **Firebase Authentication Navigation**: Fixed issues with navigation after login on Android
- **TTS on Android**: Implemented robust error handling and retry logic
- **Long Path Errors (Windows)**: May occur when building Windows app if project path is too long
